# Hi, I'm Riccardo Frignani 👋

**Final-year BSc in Computer, Electronic & Telecommunications Engineering (UniPR)**  
**Specialization:** Digital Communication Systems — **OFDM, OTFS, LDPC (DVB-S2), 5G/6G PHY**

- 🎯 *Goal:* technical–managerial path in telecom/ICT (R&D → Tech Lead → PM)
- 🔭 *Current focus:* **OTFS vs OFDM** under **multipath–Doppler** channels; link-level simulations and performance benchmarking
- 📍 Parma, Italy • 💼 Open to internship opportunities (EU/remote) from Oct 2025

## 🔬 What I work on
- **OFDM + LDPC (DVB-S2)**: end-to-end chain, **BER vs SNR/EbN0**, coding gain analysis  
- **OTFS**: delay–Doppler domain modulation, equalization strategies, **robustness to high Doppler**  
- **Channel models**: **AWGN**, **multipath TU/ETU-like**, **time-varying Doppler** (LEO/vehicular)  
- **Networking/ICT**: LAN/Wi-Fi, troubleshooting, small infra & automation
